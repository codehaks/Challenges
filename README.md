# What is the Challenge

You've been asked to extend the SqlDoc codebase.
SQL Doc is a tool for describing an existing SQL database in a human-readable format.
The first iteration is a CLI that outputs plain text, but there are plans to expand it if the tool is successful.
Our focus will be on the part of the codebase that represents database objects and translates them into an output.

You're viewing a subset of the code, a library that models the database.


Spend a few minutes familiarising yourself with the codebase and associated test.

Is there anything you'd improve about the codebase?
How would you explain those improvements to a less experienced colleague?

Can you fix the failing test?
